For plotting from learnt CSVs:
(these include all CSV files in ML output files)

note:
* some csvs dont have headers. they should be in the csvs (open excel and add manually):
- column a: value
- column b: lat
- column c: lon

remember:

* a high hygiene score = bad
* a high rating = good
this is why 2 different scripts for different colors. you can modify colors by changing the rgb values in set_color
